# Combo_Finder
This Python project generates unique product combinations from a fixed list and filters them based on whether their total price falls within a specified range. It uses random sampling and conditional checks to simulate product bundle selection, making it useful for pricing analysis, promotional planning, or e-commerce combo generation.
